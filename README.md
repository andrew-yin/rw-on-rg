# Competition with Random Walks on Random Graphsâ€”Illinois Geometry Lab Spring 2022

This repository serves as our "central storage" for our codebase, examples/visualizations, and other relevant material for our project.

## Examples
1. Plotting a random walk's visited proportion of vertices on an Erdos-Renyi random graph for each step over k samples.
